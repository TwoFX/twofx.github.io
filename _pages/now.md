I have the privilege to lead the development of [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/)'s
standard library. This is a dream job: I get to play a key role in making Lean
the best software verification tool there is, and I get to embark on this journey
both as part of a great team at the [Lean FRO](https://lean-fro.org/team/) as
well as together with some amazing members of the
[Lean community](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/).

I am convinced that a high-quality standard library will be an important piece
of the puzzle making Lean the first truly economical formal methods tool.
Therefore, I am thinking a lot both about real-world software verification in general and
maintenance and QA for proof libraries in particular. I believe that achieving
the highest quality standards is possible only with support from useful tools,
and so I am [building such a tool](https://github.com/TwoFX/grove). Development
is currently in an early stage. It is a very exciting time for me, because this
is the first time I am building something this complex entirely from scratch.

Outside of work, I am a runner. Last autumn, I ran my first marathon in 3:05:46.
In late September, I would like to break the three hour barrier. I ran a 15k
in January that I was very happy with (56:54), but unfortunately I have had very
long stretches of being sick since then, so I have not been able to do much training
in the first half of 2025. I hope to get back into the full swing of training very
soon.
