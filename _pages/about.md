I am a software developer with a background in mathematics. I am interested in
many things, including formal verification, algorithm engineering and ILP solving
on the computer side, and topology on the mathematics side.

At work, I am a Research Software Engineer/Tech Lead at the [Lean FRO](https://lean-fro.org/).

In my free time, I am a [mathlib maintainer](https://leanprover-community.github.io/teams/maintainers.html).

You can reach me by sending me a message on [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) or
sending me an e-mail at my first name at my [employer's website](https://lean-fro.org/).
